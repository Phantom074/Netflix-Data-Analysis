ðŸŽ¬ Netflix Data Analysis
This project presents a detailed analysis of the Netflix dataset, with the goal of uncovering meaningful insights into content distribution, global reach, and audience preferences. Netflix is one of the most influential streaming platforms in the world, and analysing its content trends helps understand how it has expanded, diversified genres, and adapted to user demand.

The project starts with Data Collection and Cleaning, ensuring the dataset is accurate and usable by removing duplicates, filling missing values, and standardizing formats. Once prepared, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is carried out to explore relationships and patterns in the dataset. This involves studying content type distribution (Movies vs. TV Shows), release year trends, popular genres, and country-wise contributions.

To make these findings more understandable, the project applies Data Visualization using Python libraries. Charts, bar graphs, heatmaps, and word clouds highlight the key insights visually. The analysis shows that Netflix has grown significantly since 2015, with Movies making up about 70% of its library. Genres such as Dramas, Comedies, and International Movies are most common. Geographically, the United States, India, and the United Kingdom emerge as leading contributors to Netflixâ€™s content base.

In addition to descriptive analysis, the project can incorporate Machine Learning models to make predictive recommendations. For example, clustering or classification techniques can help predict user preferences, while recommendation systems can be enhanced by analysing viewing trends.
